Background of the enterprise :
Business named "The Nidas Footwear" is a small business chain consisting of  5 shops , each shop having a staff of up to 10 people . The business is growing rapidly , because of customer satisfaction and quality of footwear that business is providing to the customers.

Current IT setup :
-> Currently , all the shops have their independent POS (Point of Sales systems) that is keeping the record of all the mentioned below things up to three month for all the shops independently.
              - Daily Customer Billing and sales.
              -Daily financial of the only concerned shop for all the products.
              - Transactions of Cash/Inventory in the shop
                - Discounts if we want to apply on a product.
                -  Attendance and Salary of the staff               
There are some of the reasons because of which the IT head and owner of the business is worried because of rapid growth of business that are mentioned below 
-> The shops are not interconnected through any medium, meaning all the shops have their independent data on their POS .
-> The shops don't have any end ERP system where we are gathering all the information about inventory , warehouse , products , daily sales , Purchases , Production of the material, Information of Customers and Vendors etc.
-> It is much difficult to scale the POS vertically or Horizontally ( By memory or Speed/Ram) in short time span.
-> The business don't have any security measures over the data.
-> IT head/ Owner can't access data from anywhere other than the POS systems.

Contrast of cloud vs non-cloud solutions for each aspect of the infrastructure:

The concerned supply chain business is spending a good amount of capital but the solution is not effective in terms of management and reliability. So, the plan is to move all the systems to a unified local server or Cloud that should have a small sized ERP system and data Integration services to integrate  the data from POS to ERP ( that is whether on cloud or on Local Server, which we will decide in the next portion).
For supply chain business Infrastructure to grow rapidly , we need a solution that must be cost effective , secure, accessible for the desired roles , easily salable and must have high performance and speed for deployments and migrations.

Recommendation, noting whether non-cloud, or if cloud, what service level and deployment type is appropriate for each aspect of infrastructure:
Business is considering different aspects of infrastructure to decide whether they have to migrate the business to a local Server or Cloud , that are described as follows.

1-Accessiblilty:

In cloud , data is accessible any where in the world of all the chain stores to the permissible roles. 
Whereas , in non-cloud or local servers accessibility is not that much easy.

2-Scalability:
It is very easy to scale systems vertically ( By Ram/ Speed ) or horizontal ( By space / ROM) in just one click with the concept of virtual machines and storage mechanisms that cloud provides.
Whereas, non-cloud or local servers , it is very difficult to scale machines or servers in an efficient time with the safety of data. 

3- Cost efficiency:
In cloud, we use pay as you grow mechanism meaning we can expand systems vertically or horizontally  just in one click with the needs of business and we don't have to purchase any hardware , so cloud is more cost efficient.
Whereas in non-cloud or local servers , we have to spend capita to purchase hardware for speed or storage and if the business don't require that  in future or in any specific season , that hardware is a wastage of money.

4-back up and restore data.
In cloud, cloud is taking care of back-up and restore of data whereas in non-cloud, we have to spend extra resources , time, capital for backup and restore of data.

5- Loss of data :

There are very less chances for the loss of very useful data of business in cloud because of security protocols of cloud.
Where as in non-cloud, chances of loss of data are comparatively high , and for the security of the data , business have to spend a great amount of data.

6-Training for the Implementation :

In cloud, the resources managing IT infrastructure require more training than in non-cloud or local server to manage IT infrastructure in cloud according to cost efficiency. But , if the person / team is highly trained than the chances for a good Business technical implementation is high in Cloud. 
7- Deployment time:
	The server is up and running seconds after you configure it where as Non-cloud take Longer deployment times.

Justification for each final recommendation provided :
As described above in the comparison portion of cloud and Non-cloud infrastructure for "The Nidas Footwear"  , Non-cloud Infrastructure limits company to scale rapidly  because people will be focused more on maintenance and upgradation of infrastructure rather than the growth of business and the satisfaction of client. More ever, Cloud is also the cost effective , more secure and fast integrator solution for the business needs .
